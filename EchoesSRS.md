# Echoes â€” Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Working name:** Echoes

**Tagline:** Turn conversations into timeless family stories.

**Purpose:** Build a polished Flutter prototype that captures grandparentsâ€™ spoken memories and converts them into (A) polished memory cards and (B) child-friendly bedtime stories. The prototype will emphasize a Duolingo-style gamified prompt system, high polish, and a demo-ready end-to-end flow using DeepGram (or Google Cloud STT) for Speech-to-Text, Supabase for Auth/Storage, and serverless Edge Functions for orchestration.

---

## 1. Vision & Core Value

Echoes preserves intergenerational knowledge by making it simple and delightful for grandparents to share life stories and for families to consume them as both archive posts and bedtime stories. The core value is emotional preservation and intergenerational bondingâ€”delivered with high polish and playful, gamified UX inspired by Duolingo.

---

## 2. Target Users & Personas

* **Family Historian (Grandparent)**: Wants easy, low-friction way to tell stories; values accessibility (large buttons, voice-first).
* **Bedtime Reader (Parent / Child)**: Wants short, magical, narrated stories derived from family memories.
* **Archivist (Adult Family Member)**: Wants searchable, exportable, private family archive.

---

## 3. Success Criteria (aligned to judging rubric)

* **Craft (1â€“10):** Demonstrate a single feature executed exceptionally well: record â†’ transcribe â†’ polished memory + bedtime story â†’ play. App must be smooth, accessible, and bug-free for demo.
* **Novelty (1â€“10):** The Duolingo-style gamified prompts + transformation into bedtime stories should feel original and unexpected.
* **Utility (1â€“10):** The product must solve the real problem of storing oral histories and making them usable by children and families.
* **Taste (1â€“10):** Design must be warm, playful, and refined. Use Duolingo-inspired mascot, bright palette, micro-interactions, and clear copy to impress judges.

Final score: sum of the four dimensions.

## 4. MVP Scope (hackathon-focused)

**MVP must include:**

1. Authentication & family creation (Supabase).
2. One-tap recording (WAV/FLAC), local save and upload to Supabase.
3. Processing pipeline (Edge Function / FastAPI): call DeepGram (or Google STT) to transcribe, then run an LLM-based `polish` step to create an adult memory and a bedtime story.
4. Bedtime story playback using `flutter_tts` (platform) and illustrated flipbook UI (use pre-generated illustrations or Stable Horde).
5. Gamified prompt system (Daily prompt + streaks + badges) in Duolingo style.
6. Simple Memory Library UI (list + detail + convert to bedtime story).

**Optional but valuable:** PDF export, shareable family-only links, high-quality TTS via server-side Coqui.

---

## 5. Tech Stack (preferred)

### Frontend

* Flutter (stable channel)
* go_router for navigation
* provider for state management
* flutter_sound for recording
* flutter_tts for playback
* hive for local cache
* dio for HTTP
* cached_network_image
* supabase_flutter for auth/storage integration

### Backend & Orchestration

* Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Storage) â€” main BaaS
* Supabase Edge Functions (or Vercel serverless) for secure third-party calls (DeepGram, LLM endpoints, Stable Horde)
* Processing service (FastAPI) â€” optional if you prefer a single server for heavy tasks

### ML / 3rd party

* Speech-to-text: **DeepGram** (preferred) or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
* LLM for polishing: Hugging Face Inference API / OpenAI (if credits) or local LLM (small) â€” keep decisions pluggable
* Image generation: Stable Horde / pre-generated Stable Diffusion assets
* TTS (backup): platform TTS via `flutter_tts`; advanced: Coqui TTS server

### Dev tooling

* Flutter SDK, Dart, Supabase CLI, Docker (for local dev of edge functions or FastAPI), Make (Makefile) to automate dev tasks

## 6. Architecture & Data Flow

1. **Record (client)** â†’ save locally and upload to Supabase `audio-raw` bucket.
2. **Start transcribe (Edge Function)** â€” client POSTs `memory_id` to `start-transcribe` endpoint.
3. **Edge Function** downloads audio, calls DeepGram for transcription (server-side API key), saves transcript to DB.
4. **Polish step**: Edge Function calls LLM or runs local polishing template to produce `polished_text` and `bedtime_story_text` and updates DB.
5. **Image generation (async)**: request illustration generation (optional). Store images in `images` bucket.
6. **Client** listens to Realtime DB changes and updates UI state; when published, child-friendly story appears in Storybook.

State transitions: `draft` â†’ `uploaded` â†’ `transcribing` â†’ `transcribed` â†’ `polishing` â†’ `polished` â†’ `published`/`failed`.

---

## 7. Data Model

**User**: `id, email, name, avatar_url, created_at`

**Family**: `id, name, owner_id, created_at`

**Memory**: `id, family_id, author_id, title, raw_audio_url, transcript, polished_text, bedtime_story_text, illustration_urls[], tts_audio_url, tags[], is_child_friendly, privacy, state, created_at, processed_at`

**ExportJob**: `id, family_id, memory_ids[], status, result_url, created_at`

Supabase storage buckets: `audio-raw`, `audio-tts`, `images`, `exports`.

---

## 9. UX / UI Requirements â€” Duolingo-style theme

**Design pillars:** playful, encouraging, high-contrast readability for elders, bright brand colors, tiny mascot (friendly owl-like creature), gamified microcopy and animations.

**Design tokens:**

* Primary: `#6CC644` (green) â€” Duolingo-ish friendly green
* Accent: `#FFB86B` (warm orange)
* Secondary: `#4A90E2` (calm blue)
* Background: `#FFFDF7` (warm off-white)
* Surface: `#FFFFFF` (cards)
* Text primary: `#0B1F2D` (very dark)
* Font family: system serif for story text (e.g., "Merriweather" or "Georgia") and sans for UI (e.g., "Inter").

**Mascot & micro-interactions:**

* Small mascot sits on the recording screen and cheers when a memory is saved.
* Streaks indicator on home: "+1 Memory Today" with confetti.
* Gentle onboarding tutorial with big, accessible copy.

**Key screens:**

1. **Onboarding / Family setup** â€” large CTAs, optional tutorial.
2. **Home / Prompt feed (Duolingo-style)** â€” daily card with a question prompt, big green "Record" button, streak & progress ring.
3. **Record screen** â€” large circular record button, waveform, mascot animation, skip / stop actions.
4. **Processing screen** â€” friendly progress states ("Whispering to the cloud..."), ability to cancel.
5. **Memory detail** â€” polished adult memory card (typography, margin), tags, convert to bedtime story button.
6. **Storybook** â€” flipbook UI, page-turn animation, illustrated background, play/pause narrator, reading level toggle.
7. **Library / Timeline** â€” Memory tree visualization with branches growing as stories added.
8. **Settings / Privacy** â€” sharing controls, delete, export.

**Copy examples:**

* Prompt: "Tell me about your favorite childhood hideout."
* On success toast: "Beautiful â€” we saved that memory! You've kept your streak alive. ðŸŒ¿"
* Empty library nudge: "No memories yet â€” try answering today's prompt and watch your family tree grow!"

## 10. Component & Implementation Details (Flutter)

**Widgets/components to build:**

* `PromptCard` (home feed)
* `RecorderWidget` (waveform, record/stop)
* `ProcessingStatus` (state machine UI)
* `MemoryCard` (polished text view with tags)
* `StoryFlipbook` (paged builder + TTS controls)
* `MemoryTree` (timeline/graph view)
* `StreakBadge` (shows daily streak & pop animation)

**State management:** Use `provider` with `AuthProvider`, `FamilyProvider`, `RecordProvider`, `MemoryProvider`.

**Routing:** Use `go_router` with deep links for sharing (e.g., `/memory/:id`).

---

## 11. Acceptance Criteria (for each major feature)

**Recording Flow:**

* Given a logged-in user, when they press "Record" and speak for up to 3 minutes, the app saves locally and uploads successfully; memory state moves to `uploaded`.

**Transcription Flow:**

* Given an audio file, the processing service returns a transcript with >80% word confidence for clear speech in English (for demo use DeepGram/medium model)..

**Polish & Story Conversion:**

* Given a transcript, the `polish` API returns an adult memory and a bedtime story less than 300 words, maintaining factual anchors.

**Storybook Playback:**

* Tapping Play reads the story with platform TTS; user can pause/resume and switch reading level.

**Gamification:**

* Completing 1+ memory per day increments streak; streak persists and unlocks a badge at 7-day streak.

## 12. Security & Privacy (developer must implement)

* Use Supabase Auth; verify JWT in all Edge Functions.
* Never embed DeepGram/LLM keys in client; store secrets in serverless environment variables.
* Consent modal before first recording & clear sharing settings.
* Provide delete API that cascades to remove storage objects.

---

## 13. Roadmap & Prioritization

**Phase 1 â€” Hackathon MVP (48â€“72 hours)**

* Supabase setup, Flutter skeleton, record screen (local), upload + start-transcribe edge function (DeepGram), canned polish outputs for quick demo, storybook with platform TTS, pre-generated illustrations, Duolingo-style prompt card and streak badge.

**Phase 2 â€” Post-hackathon (2â€“6 weeks)**

* LLM polishing integration, live image generation, server-side TTS, export PDF, full privacy controls, testing & QA.

**Phase 3 â€” Production**

* Scale processing, add multi-language, transcription diarization, voice-cloning (with consent), advanced search & analytics, paid subscriptions for printed books.

---

## 14. Metrics & KPIs (for judges/product)

* End-to-end time (record â†’ polished story) â€” ideally < 30s for short clips in demo.
* Number of memories saved per family (engagement).
* Streak retention rate (measure gamification).
* Average story playback completions per session (utility).

---

## 15. Testing & QA Plan

* Unit tests: domain logic (Dart)
* Widget tests: main UI flows
* Integration tests: login â†’ record â†’ upload â†’ transcribe (mock DeepGram) â†’ polish
* Backend tests: Edge Function simulations (mock DeepGram/LLM responses)
