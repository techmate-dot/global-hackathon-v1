# 🔗 Echoes Backend Integration Summary

## 📋 What Was Updated

### 1. **Backend Configuration (.env file)**
- ✅ Created `.env` file with required API keys
- 🔑 Deepgram API Key (for speech-to-text and text-to-speech)
- 🔑 Google Gemini API Key (for story generation)

### 2. **FastAPI Backend Updates**
- ✅ Fixed Google Gemini API configuration
- ✅ Updated dependencies in requirements.txt
- ✅ Added proper error handling for missing API keys
- ✅ Created startup script (`start.sh`) for easy deployment

### 3. **Flutter Backend Service**
- ✅ Updated base URL to `http://localhost:8000`
- ✅ Changed endpoints to match FastAPI routes:
  - `/stt-with-story` for audio upload and story generation
  - `/tts` for text-to-speech conversion
- ✅ Fixed request format to match FastAPI expectations
- ✅ Updated file upload parameter from `audio` to `file`

## 🚀 How It Works

### Complete Flow:
1. **User records audio** in Flutter app
2. **Audio uploaded** to `/stt-with-story` endpoint
3. **Backend processes**:
   - Deepgram converts speech to text
   - Gemini generates story from transcript
   - Deepgram converts story to speech
4. **Audio file returned** to Flutter app
5. **Flutter plays** the generated story audio

### API Endpoints:

```bash
# Main endpoint - Upload audio, get story back as audio
POST /stt-with-story
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: file (audio file)
Response: Audio file (story narration)

# Text-to-speech endpoint
GET /tts?text=story_text&voice=aura-asteria-en
Response: Audio file (speech)

# Health check
GET /
Response: {"message": "Speech-to-Text API is running 🚀"}
```

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### Backend Setup:
1. Add your API keys to `/workspace/backend/.env`
2. Run: `cd workspace/backend && ./start.sh`
3. Server will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Flutter Integration:
- ✅ Already configured to use localhost:8000
- ✅ StoryProcessingProvider added to app providers
- ✅ Recording screen integrated with backend service

## 🎯 Required API Keys

### Deepgram (Free $200 credits):
1. Visit: https://console.deepgram.com/signup
2. Sign up and verify email
3. Get API key from dashboard
4. Add to .env: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### Google Gemini (Free tier available):
1. Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Create API key
4. Add to .env: `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

## 📱 Testing the Integration

1. **Start Backend**: `cd workspace/backend && ./start.sh`
2. **Run Flutter App**: `flutter run`
3. **Test Flow**:
   - Record audio in app
   - Tap "Save & Process"
   - Audio uploads to backend
   - Generated story plays back automatically

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues:
- Check .env file has correct API keys
- Ensure Python dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify server running on port 8000

### Flutter Issues:
- For Android emulator: Change baseUrl to `http://10.0.2.2:8000`
- For iOS simulator: Use `http://localhost:8000`
- For physical devices: Use your computer's IP address

### Network Issues:
- Ensure backend server is accessible from your device
- Check firewall settings
- Verify API endpoints in Flutter service match backend routes

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Set up API keys** in backend/.env
2. **Start backend server** using start.sh
3. **Test recording flow** in Flutter app
4. **Deploy backend** to cloud service for production use

The integration is now complete and ready for testing!
